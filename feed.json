You can execute <code>dnsadblock run -config someConfigId</code> in your terminal and the process will start and stay up for as long as you have the terminal open. </p>\n<p>The <code>run</code> command supports the following flags:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\"><strong>-auto-activate</strong>\n    Run activate at startup and deactivate on exit.\n\n<strong>-bogus-priv</strong>\n    Bogus private reverse lookups.\n\n    All reverse lookups for private IP ranges (ie 192.168.x.x, etc.) are answered\n    with \"no such domain\" rather than being forwarded upstream. The set of prefixes\n    affected is the list given in RFC6303, for IPv4 and IPv6. (default true)\n\n<strong>-config</strong> value\n    Connection configuration id (from the connections list in your account).\n\n    The configuration id can be prefixed with a match condition for each query:\n    * 10.0.3.0/24=abcdef: A CIDR can be used to restrict a configuration to a subnet.\n    * 00:1c:42:2e:60:4a=abcdef: A MAC address can be used to restrict configuration\n    to a specific host on the LAN.\n\n    This parameter can be repeated. The first match wins.\n\n<strong>-config-file</strong> string\n    Custom path to configuration file.\n\n<strong>-forwarder</strong> value\n    A DNS server to use for a specified domain.\n\n    Forwarders can be defined to send proxy DNS traffic to an alternative DNS\n    upstream resolver for specific domains. The format of this parameter is \n    [DOMAIN=]SERVER_ADDR[,SERVER_ADDR...].\n\n    A SERVER_ADDR can ben either an IP[:PORT] for DNS53 (unencrypted UDP, TCP),\n    or a HTTPS URL for a DNS over HTTPS server. For DoH, a bootstrap IP can be\n    specified as follows:\n        https://dns.google/dns-query#8.8.8.8,2001:4860:4860::8888\n        \n      Several servers can be specified, separated by comas to implement failover.\n    This parameter can be repeated. The first match wins.\n\n<strong>-listen</strong> string\n    Listen address for UDP DNS proxy server. (default \"localhost:53\")\n\n<strong>-log-queries</strong>\n    Log DNS query.\n    Listen address for UDP DNS proxy server. (default \"localhost:53\")\n\n<strong>-log-format</strong>\n    The output format of the logged queries.\n    The supported formats are 'text' and 'json'. The 'json' format is a lot more\n    verbose and contains some extra fields as well\n\n<strong>-report-client-info</strong>\n    Embed clients information with queries.\n\n<strong>-setup-router</strong>\n    Automatically configures itself for a router setup.\n    Common types of router are detected to integrate gracefully. Changes applied\n    are undone on daemon exit. The listen option is ignored when this option is \n    used.\n\n<strong>-use-hosts</strong>\n    Lookup /etc/hosts before sending queries to upstream resolver. (default true)\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1e46j35fph\">Running as a service</h4>\n<p>To operate on a <strong><em>set it and forget it</em></strong> type we recommend using the <code>install</code> command.
